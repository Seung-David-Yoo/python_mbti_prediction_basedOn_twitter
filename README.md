# MBTI Personality Prediction using Different Machine Learning Algorithms and real Predictions for celebrities. 


The goal of this project is to
predict the personality type of an individual by analyzing his or
her social media post. We will be using the Myer-Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI) introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.
It is one of the most widely used personality type descriptors.
Myers-Briggs Personality Type dataset contains 8500 MBTI types
from different people and their posts. Various machine learning
algorithms can be used to predict personality types such as Naive
Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and
Support Vector Machine. In our project, we will compare and
analyze the results and accuracy of these ML algorithms and
at the end, we will propose the most accurate and effective
personality prediction model. The selected model will be used to
predict celebrity MBTI.
